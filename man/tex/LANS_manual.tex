\section*{Summary}
\textbf{Look@NanoSIMS}, or shortly \textbf{LANS}, is a program for processing and analysis of ion count image data produced by the NanoSIMS instrument. The original development of the program started back in 2008, but its active development continues until today based on input and requests from users (yes, it's more like a~long-term hobby). Although the program may be considered an `old school' in a number of aspects, it has matured well over the years. Once you get used to it, become aware of all of its features and figure out all the tricks, it allows you to analyze NanoSIMS data very thoroughly and efficiently. This document describes how to get started with the program and carry out such analyses from basic to advanced levels.

\section{Less commonly used functions in LANS}
\label{sec:level3}

This section describes functions of Look@NanoSIMS that are useful under special circumstances. Many of these functions have been added based on stimulus from colleagues and collaborators, who wanted to look at their NanoSIMS data in a special way. Thus, these functions likely distinguish Look@NanoSIMS from other programs used for NanoSIMS data processing.
