\subsection{Exporting graphics as PNG}
\setcounter{step}{0}

\goldbox{}
By default, graphical output generated by LANS is exported in the PDF format, with files stored in the \ttt{pdf} sub-folder. This output is of publishing quality. Sometimes, however, you may want to export the graphics as bitmaps in the PNG format. One of the reasons for doing this may be that the PNG files are usually smaller than the PDF files and are therefore more convenient to include in presentations. Use the following steps to export the graphics as PNG files.
\tcbe

\s In the main LANS window, select \lans{Preferences} $\ra$ \lans{Additional output options}.

\s In the new window that opens, select the \lanscb{PNG} checkbox in the the \ttt{Export graphics} box and click \lans{Apply}.

\s In the main LANS window, export the mass or ratio images by selecting \lans{Output} $\ra$ \lans{Display masses} or \lans{Display ratios}. 

\nb\bul The PNG output will be stored in the \ttt{png} sub-folder. It will look very similar to the PDF output, but it will be  a~bitmap with a~limited resolution rather than vector graphics.

\s Uncheck the \lanscb{PNG} checkbox if you no longer want to export the output as PNG. This will save some disk space.
