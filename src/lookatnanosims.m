% This is the startup script of the Look@NanoSIMS (LANS) program. To run
% the program, simply type lookatnanosims in Matlab command window and 
% press Enter.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Look@NanoSIMS was written by Lubos Polerecky @ MPI-Bremen 2008-2012.
% Development continued by LP @ Utrecht University 2013-2022.
% See http://nanosims.geo.uu.nl/LANS for more details about the program.

%% Read these NOTES before proceeding. Really. :)
%
% The graphical user interface (GUI) is defined in different *.fig files
% saved in the figs folder. By setting the units of the GUI objects to
% 'characters', the GUIs shoud look similar (and good) for all platforms
% (e.g. linux, windows, mac). Since Matlab version 2014, however, this
% may no longer be the case. Thus, if you open the older LANS version with
% a newer Matlab version, or vice versa, the appearance of LANS may not
% look as good as you would like to. If this is the case, I recommend that
% you upgrade Matlab to the version in which LANS was developed (see list
% of versions below). If you cannot do this, you can modify the GUI by
% yourself. To do this, in Matlab console, type 'guide' (without the '')
% and press enter. Then browse to the fig file that you would like to
% modify and change the positions and sizes of the GUI objects to your
% liking. Alternatively, do this through the menu: File -> New -> GUI ->
% Open existing GUI -> Browse. 
%
% The exported images (eps and pdf files) depend on the platform, and it
% seems that also on the Matlab version used. If you are not happy with the
% look of the exported images or plots (e.g. the fonts are too big or too
% small), select Settings -> Additional output options in the main menu of
% LANS to modify the appearance of the exported figures. You will need to
% experiment with the print factors until you get optimal results.
%
% To enable all features implemented in LANS, you will also need to have
% the following programs/packages installed on your system: 
% - LaTeX, including binaries for epstopdf and pdflatex, the URL (url.sty)
% and HYPERREF (hyperref.sty) packages.
% - Ghostscript (for converting EPS files to PDF).
% - a program for unzipping zip files (e.g. 7-zip under Windows, or unzip 
% under Linux or Mac-OS).
% - a program for viewing PDF files (e.g., xreader under Linux, Preview
% under Mac-OS, SumatraPDF under Windows). 
%
% When working on Ubuntu-like Linux systems, you will need to install these
% packages to make things work seemlessly: 
% - texlive-latex-base
% - texlive-latex-recommended
% + whatever other dependencies that come with these packages.
% The unzip program is installed by default.
%
% If you use Mac-OS, first check your system to find out where the 
% pdflatex and ghostscript binaries are located (e.g., /usr/texbin/ and 
% /usr/local/bin). Then modify accordingly the LATEXDIR and GSDIR variables 
% in the paths.m file. The unzip program is installed by default. The
% preview program probably too.
%
% If you use Windows, standard installation of MikTeX, Ghostscript and
% 7-Zip will do the job to make everything work correctly in LANS. However,
% in Windows 10 you also need to verify that the helvetic font is
% installed, otherwise the epstopdf conversion may not work.
%
% To make sure that all the paths are correctly defined, check the file 
% paths.m in the LANS folder. 
%
% It seems that secondary ion counts on some (newer?) systems are stored as 
% ushort (16-bit unsigned integer), whereas on some (older?) systems they
% are  stored as uint8 (8-bit unsigned integers). Perhaps this is because
% of the differences between the 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems that
% run the Cameca instrument, but I am not 100% sure. Therefore, if you
% experience problems with loading an im file, e.g. the program tells you
% that there are 0 planes even though there are for sure more, it may well
% be that this is the cause. In that case, open the file read_im_file.m in
% the fnc folder and see whether you can hack it to make things work. If
% not, contact LP who may be able to help you.
